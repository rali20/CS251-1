1. Write a bash script to accept a positive integer as input. Perform
   sanity check on the input. If the input is valid, the script should
   print all the digits in English (e.g., for input '123', output is 'one 
   two three').

2. Write a bash script to calculate words of all files rooted under a
   directory tree and print the file name only if number of words in the file is
   a prime number.

3. In the example, presented in class, the leap year logic is flawed. Modify the
   code to implement the correct logic.

4. A simple regular expression used in the examples to match a valid date in dd-mm-yyyy 
   format does not filter out all invalid dates. Improve the regular expression to 
   make it more tight (preferably match only valid dates).
